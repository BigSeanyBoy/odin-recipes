    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This 20-minute recipe is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish it in the oven). This is one of our favorite
    steak recipes and we make it year-round because it’s such a quick and convenient cooking method. That garlic butter is
    lip-smacking good! Read on for great tips on how to improve beef sustainability, reduce food waste and you will love our
    ideas for easy meal prep with leftover steak.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz. New York Strip Steak</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic Cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on
        their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic
        butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
